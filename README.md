**Instructions**

To experiment with a `cool_fig_*.ipynb` notebook:
- Run the *Jupyter* notebooks by clicking the double arrow icon `>>` or by selecting from the pull-down menu: `Kernel / Restart Kernel & Run All Cells...` then by clicking: `Restart`.
- Change the values of the widgets for the psychrometric representations presented in the paper.

The notebooks can be run interactively on mybinder.org (click the button below).
