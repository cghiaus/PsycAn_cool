**Instructions**

To experiment with a `cool_fig_*.ipynb` notebook:
- Run the notebook by clicking the double arrow icon `>>` or by selecting from the pull-down menu: `Kernel / Restart & Run all` then clicking: `Restart and Run All Cells`.
- Change the values of the widgets for the psychrometric representations.

The notebooks may run interactively on Binder.
